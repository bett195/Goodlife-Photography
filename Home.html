<p2 style='text-align:center;line-height: 32px;margin-bottom: 20px;'text-align:center;'>I went to school to study chemistry, but soon after graduating felt that something was missing in my life.<br> It’s only after picking up a camera did I start to feel excited about  the possibilities my life could take.<br> Capturing people’s special moments is one of the most rewarding things I’ve done in my life. <br>I also love going on adventures and taking my camera along with me!
